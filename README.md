# OpenCX Development Report

OpenCX is an integrated set of apps to improve the collective experience (CX) and participation of people attending professional conferences, group meetings and public spaces in general.

OpenCX explores technologies in the areas of Internet of Things (IoT) and multimedia visualization applicable to distributed services and for creating augmented spaces.

OpenCX is based on the results of the [thesis of Pedro Ayala](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/pub_geral.show_file?pi_doc_id=159427), supervised by Ademar Aguiar and Miguel Carvalhais, to be released as opensource (Open). 

Teams
---
The project is developed in the context of the [Software Engineering course of the Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=436443), coordinated by Ademar Aguiar and Filipe Correia, with contributions from [36 small teams of students from MIEIC/ESOF course, 2019/20 edition](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/fest_geral.fotos_estud_inscritos_list?pv_ocorrencia_id=436443&pv_dimensao_matriz=6).

Process
---
OpenCX has a strong pedagogical motivation, a kind of playground for several software engineering practices, both from traditional (e.g. 'weighty' Unified Process) and agile processes (e.g. Extreme Programming).

The development follows a simple iterative process, organized in the four phases of Unified Process (Inception, Elaboration, Construction, Transition), encompassing activities mostly from Requirements, Design, Implementation, Test, and Deployment disciplines, and a few from Business Modeling, Change Management, and Project Management.

Artifacts
---
During the 12 weeks of initial development under the context of MIEIC/ESOF, several deliverables will be produced, being the following ones considered mandatory, for each team and their apps, organized by discipline:

* Business Modeling
    * Vision
    * Elevator Pitch
* Requirements
    * Use Cases: UML Use-Cases diagram, high-level description of actors, and use cases.
    * User stories: user-story map, and per user story, a brief description, user-interface mockups, the most important usage scenarios (i.e. concrete examples), and respective acceptance tests (written in Gherkin).
    * Domain analysis: UML Classes diagram, including key domain concepts and relationships, and entries to the glossary of terms global to the project.
* Architecture and Design
    * Technological architecture: UML deployment and component diagrams with technologies, components, and devices.
    * Design decisions: problems, options, chosen solution, possibly using design or architectural patterns.
* Implementation
    * Source code updates
    * Documentation updates: feature requests, bug fixes, improvements.
* Test
    * Functional tests, integration tests, acceptance tests, as much automated as possible.
* Change management
    * Git repository
* Project management
    * Tasks management tool 

Tools
---
There are many possibilities to support the process and the production of the artifacts required. However, we suggest the following (optional):
* Github (Classroom), to store source code, models, and documentation, change requests.
* Visual Studio Code, as multilanguage code editor
* Visual Paradigm, for UML diagrams
* Trello, for Tasks Management
* HackMD to edit documents collaboratively, and synced with Github

Technologies
---
* mobile apps:
    * Flutter?
    * Ionic?
    * React?
* badge apps:
    * microbit
* things
    * beacons
    * 
* server/services:
    * RaspberryPi
    * VPS at FEUP


Environment
---
The target environment is the upcoming <Programming> 2020 Conference, 23-26 March 2020, to be held at FEUP, Porto, Portugal.
