# OpenCX

OpenCX is an integrated set of apps aimed to improve the collective experience (CX) of participants attending professional conferences, group meetings and public spaces in general.

OpenCX explores technologies in the areas of Internet of Things (IoT) and multimedia visualization applicable to distributed services and for creating augmented spaces.

OpenCX is based on the results of the [thesis of Pedro Ayala (Master on Multimedia)](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/pub_geral.show_file?pi_doc_id=159427), supervised by Ademar Aguiar and Miguel Carvalhais. 

OpenCX is planned to be released under an opensource license.

Teams
---
OpenCX is developed in the context of the [Software Engineering course of the Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=436443), coordinated by [Ademar Aguiar](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=231081), [Filipe Correia](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=486352), and [Rui Neves](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=618538), with contributions from [36 development teams of students](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/fest_geral.fotos_estud_inscritos_list?pv_ocorrencia_id=436443&pv_dimensao_matriz=6) from MIEIC/ESOF course, 2019/20 edition, [2 agile coaches](), students from MIEIC/MADS course, 2019/20 edition, and [Jo√£o Pedro Dias](https://jpdias.me), as IoT expert, doctoral student of ProDEI. 

Process
---
OpenCX has a strong pedagogical motivation, being a kind of playground for several software engineering practices, blending practices both from traditional processes (e.g. Unified Process) and agile processes (e.g. Extreme Programming).

The development follows a simple iterative process, organized in the four phases of Unified Process (Inception, Elaboration, Construction, Transition), and encompassing activities not only from Requirements, Design, Implementation, Test, and Deployment disciplines, but also a few other activities from Business Modeling, Change Management, and Project Management.

Artifacts
---
During the 12 weeks of initial development under the context of MIEIC/ESOF, several deliverables will be produced, being the following ones considered mandatory, for each team and their apps, all briefly described below organized by discipline:

* Business Modeling
    * Vision
    * Elevator Pitch
* Requirements
    * Use Cases: UML Use-Cases diagram, high-level description of actors, and use cases.
    * User stories: user-story map, and per user story, a brief description, user-interface mockups, the most important usage scenarios (i.e. concrete examples), and respective acceptance tests (written in Gherkin).
    * Domain analysis: UML Classes diagram, including key domain concepts and relationships, and entries to the glossary of terms global to the project.
* Architecture and Design
    * Technological architecture: UML deployment and component diagrams with technologies, components, and devices.
    * Design decisions: problems, options, chosen solution, possibly using design or architectural patterns.
* Implementation
    * Source code updates
    * Documentation updates: feature requests, bug fixes, improvements.
* Test
    * Functional tests, integration tests, acceptance tests, as much automated as possible.
* Change management
    * Git repository
* Project management
    * Tasks management tool 

Tools
---
There are many possibilities to support the process and the production of the artifacts required. However, we suggest the following (optional):
* Github Classroom), to manage source code, models, and documentation, and change requests.
* Visual Studio Code, as a multilanguage code editor.
* Visual Paradigm, for UML diagrams.
* Trello, for Tasks Management.
* HackMD to edit documents collaboratively, and sync with Github.

Technologies
---
* mobile apps:
    * Flutter?
    * Ionic?
    * React?
* badge apps:
    * microbit
* things
    * beacons
    * 
* services:
    * RaspberryPi
    * VPS at FEUP
    * ...


Environment
---
The target environment is the upcoming [&lt;Programming&gt; 2020, the 4th International Conference on the Art, Science and Engineering of Programming](https://2020.programming-conference.org), to be held on 23-26 March 2020, at FEUP, Porto, Portugal.
